This directory contains libraries not avilable in public repositories, such as
VistALink.

Note that these VistALink JARs were copied from this public GitHub repository:
<https://github.com/shabiel/vistalink-tester-for-linux/tree/385eb6212/samples-J2SE>.
The ASRC team verified that they are the same as the official VA distribution
via m5sum.
